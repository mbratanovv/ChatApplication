TO DO:
Mario :
      - try to make the coordinator functionality 
      - change the whole structure of the code (50%)
      - make the code in MVC format (sunday)
for the coordinator :
      - use the working functionality about the list of users currently online
      - assign a boolean variable to the first user that connects (use the arraylist to get its first value(first user connected)) and while he is online - the boolean variable is true;
      - when he disconnects, the next first user in the list will become coordinator (the loop will look through the arraylist each time a new user connects?)
      - only the coordinator can use the "online" function ?, if not coordinator - message pop up that he is not authorised to use this command
Jordan - get familiarised with the code and how it works and all the classes (Thursday)
       - Handle creation of the coordinator and assigning coordinator role
